 - [ ] The second class should be a class that defines the graph. You may use any graph representation that allows an unlimited number of vertices and edges. It should have the following public methods 
	- [ ] A method to add a vertex 
	- [ ] A method to add an edge 
	- [ ] A method that checks whether the graph has cycles 
	- [ ] A method to check whether the graph is connected 
	- [ ] A method that returns a list of vertices resulting from a depth-first graph search 
	- [ ] A method that returns a list of vertices resulting from a breadth-first graph search 
	- [ ] You may add any other methods as needed.
