/*
  The third class is should be an extension of the javafx Pane class that visually displays the graph. It should contain 
	- [x] an event handler that responds to mouse clicks that creates new vertices
		- where is the best place for it in the code? in the constructor?
	- [ ] a method that is called to draw edges.Â

/*
THOUGHTS 
- potienal problem with trying to get the text field information will probably need to change where the variable gets created? definitely something that will come up later 
- Maybe using grid pane would be better than border pane?? would it matter when it comes to placing actual vertices? 
- Don't want the screen to be resizable
